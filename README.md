# wordlists

A place to store my own wordlists, and link to others that are useful

## SecLists

* https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
  * "SecLists is the security tester's companion. It is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, and many more."
  * Massive collection of wordlists.. but comes in pretty weighty (~320mb + git overheads) when you only end up using a couple of the lists..
  * I mostly seem to end up using https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web_Content
